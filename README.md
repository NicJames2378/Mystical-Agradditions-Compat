A simple mod to add support for tier 6 seeds in the Immersive Engineering gardening cloche.

This mod is an addon for Mystical Agradditions, Immersive Engineering.

Simply install and use!

 

MA seeds can now go into the gardening cloche. However, you cannot simply use dirt! That would be very overpowered ;). Instead, you will place the appropriate crux in the dirt slot of the interface. After applying power and water, your tier 6 seeds should begin to grow! Also, all fertilizers compatible with the cloche will now work with these seeds. Enjoy!

 

Modpacks: Blah blah, who cares! Just credit me (and the other creators!). 

Note: This is my first mod, so let me know of any issues you encounter! It should work with anything compatible with Mystical Agriculture and Immersive Engineering.
